Your error is in "we do one's compliment and get -7". To see why this is wrong, take the one's complement of 7 and add 7 to it. If it's -7, you should get zero because -7 + 7 = 0. You won't.
The one's complement of 7 was 1000
. Add 7 to that, and you get 1111
. Definitely not zero. You need to add one more to it to get zero!
The negative of a number is the number you need to add to it to get zero.
If you add 1
 to ...11111
, you get zero. Thus -1 is represented as all 1 bits.
If you add a number, say x
, to its 1's complement ~x
, you get all 1 bits.
Thus:~x + x = -1
Add 1 to both sides:~x + x + 1 = 0
Subtract x from both sides:~x + 1 = -x

```
x + ~x = -1
x = - (~x + 1)
-x = ~x + 1
```
