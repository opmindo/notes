Zookeeper development [started in 2007](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=670794), while the first drafts of the [Raft](https://raftconsensus.github.io/) algorithm were [published in 2013](http://files.catwell.info/misc/mirror/raft/raft.pdf). That said, Zookeeper’s [Zab](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Zab+in+words) algorithm is actually fairly similar to Raft at a high level. It is not quite as simple as Raft, but it already [works well](https://aphyr.com/posts/291-call-me-maybe-zookeeper) and is supported by its own [proof of correctness](http://labs.yahoo.com/files/YL-2010-007.pdf). Any simplicity advantage of replacing Zab with Raft in Zookeeper would be vastly outweighed by the years of work needed to implement, optimize, test, and mature a new algorithm.However, the story for MongoDB is quite different. MongoDB implements a set of ad-hoc consensus strategies that don’t come with formal proofs and, in practice, [fail to provide the guarantees that they claim](https://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb). Replacing this with something like Raft would be an important improvement, and some developers are [working on this](http://www.tokutek.com/2014/07/introducing-ark-a-consensus-algorithm-for-tokumx-and-mongodb/), but it’s unclear if this work will be merged upstream.This sounds really embarrassing for the MongoDB developers—and it should—but MongoDB is not at all an isolated case. If you actually apply rigorous tests to almost any software other than Zookeeper that claims to provide distributed consensus, you [find that it doesn’t work](https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen). (Even for software that [claims to be based on a Raft implementation](https://aphyr.com/posts/316-call-me-maybe-etcd-and-consul).)The moral is that distributed consensus, like secure cryptography, is a really complicated problem that programmers can’t just code their way out of without turning to the academic literature. Formal proofs are tangibly important in practice. Hopefully the simplicity and understandability of Raft will promote improvement in this area; it provides an excellent theoretical foundation. But for now it seems the only way to build a reliable distributed system is to just use Zookeeper.
